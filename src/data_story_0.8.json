      "Image1&2 - Narrative Facet": "I inherited a home from an aunt I never met. She was apparently an aunt that was twice removed, due to my father's dad remarrying a few different times. She never had kids of her own and my dad wrote to her monthly including pictures of me as I grew up. I was the only child my father had. The house was a small cottage. Enough for me and my husband. We were looking to start a family once we found a house. This seemed to be pure luck. You could not tell from the outside, but there was a basement. A huge basement. It almost seemed to be bigger than the one story home above. I don't know what plans she had for it, but it was definitely a work in progress. This could have easily been a living unit apart from the home, it's bigger than our old apartment.",
      "Image1&2&3 - Narrative Facet": "This basement gave me the creeps. I never went down there past the first day we were looking around. We soon moved in and started to update the home. At this point we just wanted to focus on the main floor and figure out the drab basement later. Our first night in the new home was nice, until we went to bed. It was midnight when I first heard it. It sounded like a chain being dragged along the cement flooring below. I heard grunts and grumbles. I woke my husband up and insisted we go check it out. He grabbed a baseball bat and I grabbed a knife and a flash light. We descended down the stairs and flipped the switches. The sound was no longer happening, but the air felt... It was hard to explain. It felt disturbed. Almost like when someone exits the room suddenly and you still feel their presence there. We rounded the corner and went down the hallway. We had not explored this far in since the first day. There was a light coming from the left side of the hall. both sides of the hallway dead end at one point. We went towards the light and there was a door that I can promise was not there the first day. My husband seemed just as confused as I was. On the door was a envelope, ran over and pulled it off the door before running back away from the door. I opened it and it was from my aunt. \\\\ `I did not mention this in my previous letter, because you would not understand unless you saw it with your own eyes. Behind this door is a great fortune. More than all the banks in the world. This should help you and your husband start your little family. I have three things I ask of you before you proceed. 1: You must only take what you need as you need it. Nothing more. 2: No one else can know about this outside of you and your husband. Not even your father. 3: In return to receiving this fortune, you has to tend to the guard of that room. He will not harm either of you, but in order to obtain any of the money in there, you must feed him each time you enter. This is the only way he knows he can trust you. He does not eat kibble or anything conventional. No. You have to feed him meat. Fresh meat. Flesh. He is very picky and will only take what he asks for...` I stop at the next line. I didn't want to finish it. My husband asked how horrible it could be. I continued; `Do not be alarmed if he wants human flesh. That is his favorite.` My husband and I looked at each other. The groaning and grinding of a chain across the floor started again just behind the door."

Marco sat at his desk and reviewed the upcoming schematics for the building and was making the necessary changes to ensure structural integrity when he received a phone call.  He answered the phone and it was his boss, he wanted to know if Marco could go to an upcoming educational training event that was being held in Sacramento California to help better understand the engineering of sky scrapers.  Marco had always wanted to go to California to visit and see the ocean, so he happily agreed, especially after his boss offered to pay his expenses and travel.  Marco went home and packed up a suit case of everything he would need for the trip.  He came into work the next day with the suit case and lay it up against a wall with his jacket hanging up above it.  As work came to an end, Marco walked over and dusted off his suit case since it had some dust land on it due to the green machinery near by and begin to leave the building.",

Marco laughs and tells them that this is still mostly a business trip for him, he just gets to see the ocean for the first time.  One of the men sits down on a concrete slab and tells Marco that the water in California is supposedly very cold.  The man continues to tell Marco that if he wants to go swimming, he better prepare for the cold chills he's going to get.  Macro laughs and says he will keep it in mind and thanks him, he knows they mean well and are just poking some fun with him.  Macro exits the building and gets in his car where he then drives to the airport.  Upon arrival he is checked by security and is checked in as he takes his seat, he opens up a brochure for Sacramento and starts to plan out what he wants to do after the engineering convention is over.  He beings to circle multiple places he would like to visit as a lady on the intercom says, `Now boarding Flight 1742 for Sacramento.`  Marco stands up and walks over to the stand ready to board the plane.  Soon he will be in Sacramento and get to see the ocean for the first time in his life."

      "Image1&2 - Narrative Facet": "A woman went out into the desert one day on a geological survey. There were many places she could have gone, but she knew about the mineral deposits by the cacti. She couldn't really remember the color of the cacti, but she knew they shape. When she finally found the location she, casually, leaned down to inspect the ground.",
      "Image1&2&3 - Narrative Facet": "While the woman was studying the rocks, a stranger approached her. He was skinny, and vaguely adolescent in his features. He asked the woman about the rocks and why they had such interesting formations. The woman went on to explain all of the geological factors that go into forming rock. After awhile the boy became bored and vanished as quickly as he appeared."

All the travelers seemed to stop at a certain location miles before the monument. They would stop for a few minutes, looking down, then continue. The Sioux waited until it had cleared out and came up to where this happened, looked down and saw a rusty red rock in a tuft of grass. The Sioux were puzzled, scared, and concerned.

There were no librarians at the desk, no patrons looking at the rows of periodicals stored beyond the desk. I felt a nervous sweat begin to break out. I didn't even see any homeless people snoozing in the armchairs or anyone in any of the two computer rooms to each side of the circulation desk. At 2:00 PM on a Tuesday afternoon, this library should be bustling. `What's going on here?` I wondered. `Am I dreaming? Is this real?`"

The tables are chairs are smaller and brightly colored. The bookshelves that hold the young readers' books are shorter so the kids can reach. Behind them, taller bookshelves hold the teen and young adult books. There are kids magazines in the racks on the walls. This is a nice place to sit in a comfy armchair and read.",
      "Image2 - Scene Facet": "This is another floor of the public library. This is an adult section. The armchairs and bookshelves are larger. There are long tables with reading lamps so people can study. There are many comfortable armchairs where people can relax and read.",
      "Image3 - Scene Facet": "This is the circulation desk for the reference library. There are two chairs for librarians to sit. They have a computer to look up books or check out materials for library patrons. There is a rolling rack for returned books, but it is empty right now. Behind the circulation desk are many rows of shelves holding magazines, newspapers and other periodicals. There is a very large window at the end of the room letting in lots of natural light.",
      "Image1&2 - Narrative Facet": "I love libraries. Whenever I come back to my hometown, I always have to make a visit to our public library and relive all my happy memories. Walking into the ground floor, I pause to take a deep breath, I love the smell of thousands of books living together. The ground floor is the children's library. I don't check out many books from here these days, but I like to walk along the stacks. I remember when I was so young that these bright tables and chairs looked huge to me. I don't linger here too long, but take the stairs up to the second floor. The second floor is the research area of the library where all of the encyclopedias, magazines and non-fiction are kept. This is easily my favorite floor. The wooden columns are the same color as the wood on the bookshelves. The armchairs are the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in. This is where my research will begin. I wander off into the stacks to begin my search.",
      "Image1&2&3 - Narrative Facet": "As I wandered the stacks, the little hairs on the back of my neck began to stand up. Something felt wrong. I sniffed the air again but there were no odors but the smell of old books and newspapers. I walked up and down a few aisles. Then it hit me. There weren't any sounds. Even the quietest library will have the murmur of patrons and librarians going about their business. I stopped in my tracks. Had I seen anyone at all in the library? The front doors were open and unlocked. I hurried to the circulation desk in the middle of the room. It was just as empty as the children's floor and reference floor had been. There were no librarians at the desk, no patrons looking at the rows of periodicals stored beyond the desk. I felt a nervous sweat begin to break out. I didn't even see any homeless people snoozing in the armchairs or anyone in any of the two computer rooms to each side of the circulation desk. At 2:00 PM on a Tuesday afternoon, this library should be bustling. `What's going on here?` I wondered. `Am I dreaming? Is this real?`"

He felt the hairs rise on his arms and the back of his neck. Something seemed wrong. The style of the stones and bricks used seemed far too old for this area. Then again, he reasoned, he really didn't know much about this state and he'd never hiked this area before. He shrugged off his shivers, deciding that he was being silly, and stepped through the arch. Once through, it was like he stepped into another world. Instead of being on the side of a hill, he was on a very flat lane that had trees planted in straight lines on the other side. When he looked behind him, the arch was gone. The tree-lined lane stretched off into the distance. He thought he could see a group of three people standing far down the lane.

They liked to hike this particular path whenever possible, because it was heavily forested and they felt like they were really out in the natural wilderness there, even though it was a well-maintained and patrolled path in a fairly popular park. As they turned a corner, their familiar favorite path appeared to have been replaced by something far older, and man-made. An ancient stone arch had been erected over the path, and to either side stretched a thick wall made of dirt and sod. Laney stepped off the path and saw that the wall seemed to stretch to infinity on either side. There was no way around the wall thought the trees. Thinking that perhaps they had just taken a wrong turning earlier, the friends proceeded under the arch. Once on the other side, they realized that they were nowhere they had seen before. The wild woods had been replaced by a lane flanked with trees planted in unnaturally straight lines. The fence in the distance told them they were no longer in their favorite park.

He was visiting the area for a work trip and took the opportunity of an afternoon off to hike a few of the local trails. The trail he chose was for beginners and it wound gently around a forested hill. About halfway up the hill he encountered a stone arch set in a brick wall that blocked the path. He felt the hairs rise on his arms and the back of his neck. Something seemed wrong. The style of the stones and bricks used seemed far too old for this area. Then again, he reasoned, he really didn't know much about this state and he'd never hiked this area before. He shrugged off his shivers, deciding that he was being silly, and stepped through the arch. Once through, it was like he stepped into another world. Instead of being on the side of a hill, he was on a very flat lane that had trees planted in straight lines on the other side. When he looked behind him, the arch was gone. The tree-lined lane stretched off into the distance. He thought he could see a group of three people standing far down the lane. He started walking toward them, hoping they could help him find the way back."

They were so dry and brittle the sound of them crunching under their shoes sounded like breaking bones. They had their backpacks ready with any necessities they thought would be somewhat needed up the mountain and their time there. They packed it with some first aid kits, drinks, snacks, and other things. At one point they had to go through what's now an old tunnel in the middle of the woods.

Jack was the first one to arrive in front of it, his father and grandfather walked slowly behind him. They stopped and admired the old structure, walls filled with stones, the details amazed them. There was a tunnel going under the bridge which they would have to go under to continue their path and get to their destination. Once they were done admiring the old structure they continued their way that led to their final destination and went ahead and started their hike for that afternoon. The trail on the way to the mountain was always an important and admiring part of the hike, Jack could even say it was his favorite part!"

      "Image1&2&3 - Narrative Facet": "The other side of the arena is filling up as well as the team members enter the field. Its going to be a hot day on the field as even the crowds are filling up under the reprieve from the sun. The Blue Jays have joined each other on the field with their blue and white uniforms matching the sky above. As is tradition the team gets together for a huddle and a prayer to prepare themselves for the big match. The Orioles, with their Green and Orange colors have not all made it to the field yet their fans are already prepared with an orange banner flying high in support! The anticipation of the game floods from the stands to the field and back!"

The stadium is quite full during these events but people also enjoy coming during the week to watch them practice, although the stadium is usually far from capacity during the work week. The community as a whole supports these activities as you can clearly see by the bright blue banners. In just a few days it will be full of spectators as the weekend is just a couple of days away.",

Some are enjoying the warmth of the sun while others prefer to be in the shade cast by the palm tree or the stadium roof.  The players are on the field doing their pregame warm-ups.  The spectators are excited in anticipation of the start of the game.  The field is lush and green, perfect for soccer.  This is going to be the start of another great season!"
