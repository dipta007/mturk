Sure, there have been times before when only 3 or 4 people walked in, looking for help with a research project or maybe in search of a good read. But she remembers the early days of her career before the internet came along, when there would always be plenty of people in the library and how the groups of kids would show up after school, and she would constantly have to tell them `Shush ! Please be quiet, people are reading, this is a library.` But today has been nothing like that.
